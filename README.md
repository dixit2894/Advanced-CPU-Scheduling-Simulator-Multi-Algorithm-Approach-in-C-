# Advanced-CPU-Scheduling-Simulator-Multi-Algorithm-Approach-in-C++
Advanced CPU Scheduling Simulator: This C++ project models CPU scheduling algorithms, including FCFS, SJF (both preemptive and non-preemptive), Round-Robin with configurable time slices, and Preemptive Priority scheduling. It simulates process management with random arrival and burst times, using an exponential distribution for realistic behavior.
